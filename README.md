# Instructions for MAgiKeys

## About

MAgiKeys is a stripped and modified version of [MAgik](https://github.com/comebacktomorrow/MAgik).
MAgiKeys focuses on providing shortcut-based window management for MA2.

### Features include

* Window position presets 
* maybe window position storing (Ctrl+W) and restoring (Ctrl+T) window positions for a variety of multi-screen configurations
* Hold ALT and click anywhere on a MA window to drag it
* Bring GrandMA2 command window to foreground using <something>

### How it works

MAgiKeys works from within your grandma folder in program files. From there, it knows how to discover what versions of the software you have installed.
After you've placed it in there, run MAgiKeysConfig!

## MAgik hotkeys

Once you have GrandMA and MAgik running, there are also optional window management hotkeys you can use to set up your environment to your liking. 

## Getting Started

Running the raw executable won't do anything by itself first up - by design it tries not to draw attention to itself.
